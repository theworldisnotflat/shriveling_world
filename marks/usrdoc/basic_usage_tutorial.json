So once clicked on the list of predefined datasets or drag'n'drop files, you have to wait for a few seconds</em></p>\n<p><strong>Step #3</strong>: enjoy! navigate around the three dimensional structure with mouse controls, define projection through interface, define desired control parameters through the interface on the right. Reload the page in the browser before changing dataset.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-data-in-the-application-by-dragndrop\">Introducing data in the application by drag'n'drop</h2>\n<p>Drag'n'drop the following geojson and csv files found in the folder datasets in the web app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cities.csv</li>\n<li>population.csv</li>\n<li>transport_mode_code.csv</li>\n<li>transport_mode_speed.csv</li>\n<li>transport_network.csv</li>\n<li>110m_land_shrivel.geojson</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"detailed-instructions-for-use\">Detailed instructions for use</h2>\n<p>Instructions for the application are provided in a lateral user interface.</p>\n<p>Export to gltf (.obj) file format is available (red button in the bottom). In order to import in Blender the file produced from the app, <a href=\"https://github.com/ksons/gltf-blender-importer\">a Blender plugin must be installed</a></p>\n<p>Most commands can be accessed through the lateral UI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Year</strong>: base year of the representation (value in the networks files) 'Generalities', 'year'</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Cartographic projection</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Static</strong>: change 'Generalities', 'projection', 'Initial projection' the variable <em>projectionInit</em> : projection with values in in the following range :</li>\n<li>'none' for a three dimensional un-projected representation</li>\n<li>'equirectangular' or 1 for an equilateral flat representation</li>\n<li>'Mercator' or 2 for a 2-dimensional Mercator</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic</strong></li>\n<li>Set the final projection: 'Generalities', 'projection', 'final projection'</li>\n<li>'transition': transition value between projectionBegin and projectionEnd. Value included in the range 0 to 100 included.</li></ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Cones</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Color</strong>: Menu 'Cones', 'cones color'</li>\n<li><strong>Rendering quality</strong>: 'coneStep' modifies the visual aspect of cones. The default value is 15 degrees, a facet = 15°, a recommended value is 5 or less. Lower values will generate higher quality graphics, at the cost of larger export files and resource consuming rendering</li></ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Curves</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Color</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong>: curves may have a different color and transparency according to the transport mode they represent, chosen in 'Curves', 'terrestrial modes' and 'Aircraft'</li>\n<li><strong>Straight lines</strong> or <strong>curves</strong>:  the parameter 'nb of points' will populate the variable  'nbPointsPerCurve=X where X is an integer between 1 and 199 included. This value determines the way curves are drawn:</li>\n<li>The value <strong>1</strong> draws all straight lines</li>\n<li>The value <strong>2</strong> draws a broken line, as two segments with an intermediate point; the line has the desired length</li>\n<li>A value superior to <strong>2</strong> will interpolate a Bézier curve of the desired length. This curve can be a geodesic in the non projected case, or can be a longer curve. Recommended value is superior to <strong>50</strong> for a high quality graphic</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"more-parameters-with-the-console\">More parameters with the console</h2>\n<p>Instructions to the application can also be entered in the console (F12) of the browser</p>\n<p><code>shriveling.configuration.XXX=value</code></p>\n<p>with XXX and value in the following range:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>intrudedHeightRatio : sets the height of cones, in the range [0,1], a ratio of the earth radius</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"testing-lengths-and-angles\">Testing lengths and angles</h2>\n<p>As the final output of the tool is, in the general case, an image, testing the distances and angles is a way to make sure the model is correct:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>length of straight edges and links can be <a href=\"https://timespace.hypotheses.org/115\">measured with a ruler on the screen</a> or on a printed image</li>\n<li>length of curves may be measured by means of a little string adjusted along the image and then measured with the ruler</li>\n<li>measuring angles with <a href=\"https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/angle_measurement/\">an on-line protractor tool</a></li>\n</ul>"}
